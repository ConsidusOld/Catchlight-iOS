//
//  LinkDetector.swift
//  CatchlightCore — clickable links in Take bodies (owner 2026-06-22)
//
//  Pure URL detection over a Take's plain text, so it's unit-testable without a
//  host app. Two passes:
//    1. `NSDataDetector` — schemed URLs and `www.` links (the reliable path).
//    2. Bare domains with NO scheme (e.g. "catchlight.app") — matched by a
//       conservative regex and accepted ONLY when the TLD is one IANA publishes
//       (`TLDList`), then linked with an assumed `https://`.
//
//  🚨 PASS 2 IS NOT A FALLBACK FOR EXOTIC CASES — it is what makes the modern
//  web link at all. Measured 2026-09-12: `NSDataDetector` recognises 44 of 47
//  country codes but only 5 of 33 gTLDs created from 2013 onward, missing
//  `.app`, `.dev` and `.ai`. Apple's table is real (no fabricated TLD matches
//  it) but has not kept pace, and there is no sign it will, so every modern
//  bare domain links because of this pass and not because of Apple.
//
//  The list REPLACED a hand-curated set of 53 (owner, 2026-09-12). That set
//  covered 1,434 minus 1,381 of what exists, and 39 of its 53 entries were
//  redundant because Apple already caught them. It was found by the owner
//  pasting a real reference list of 51 sites, of which three did not link:
//  `cleanup.pictures`, `radio.garden`, `apinex.bond`.
//
//  Two gates keep precision, since a false link in a personal note is worse
//  than a missed one (a missed domain still works if typed with `https://`):
//    a. Four TLDs are never linked — `.md`, `.zip`, `.mov`, `.java` — because
//       each is far more often a filename here than a domain. `.app`, `.ai` and
//       `.sh` are extensions too and are deliberately KEPT, being real domains
//       in daily use. The set lives in `Scripts/generate_tld_list.py`.
//    b. The TLD must be written in lower case. This is what stops a missing
//       space after a full stop — "I went home.It was late", "Call Bob.No
//       answer" — from linking, `.it` and `.no` being Italy and Norway. A
//       domain someone means is typed "considus.com" or, with iOS
//       auto-capitalisation, "Considus.app"; nobody types "home.It". An
//       ALL-CAPS domain ("SQUOOSH.APP") is the deliberate exception, because
//       shouting a URL is a real thing people do — the MIXED case is what
//       carries the signal, not the capitals themselves.
