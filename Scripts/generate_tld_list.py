"""
Regenerate `Sources/CatchlightCore/Text/TLDList.swift` from IANA's authoritative
list of top-level domains.

    python3 Scripts/generate_tld_list.py

WHY THIS IS GENERATED AND COMMITTED, rather than fetched at run time.
Catchlight makes almost no network requests, and every one it does make is
named in a published white paper. A notes app that phoned IANA to decide
whether text is a link would add a request that leaks WHEN the user is typing,
and would break the papers' closed-set claim about what crosses the boundary.
So the list is baked into the binary at build time and this script is the only
thing that ever talks to IANA. Run it deliberately; never from CI, and never
from the app.

WHY A LIST AT ALL. `NSDataDetector` runs first in `LinkDetector` and handles
country codes well, but its own table has not kept up: measured 2026-09-12 it
caught 44/47 country codes and only 5/33 of the gTLDs created from 2013 onward,
missing `.app`, `.dev` and `.ai` among them. Bare domains on modern TLDs
therefore link only because this list says they may.

# 🚨 Never auto-linked, however live the TLD. Each of these is overwhelmingly a
# FILE EXTENSION in a notes app and vanishingly rare as a domain someone types
# into a Take, so linking them turns ordinary filenames into links (owner
# decision 2026-09-12).
#
# Deliberately NOT excluded, and the reasoning matters if this set is ever
# revisited: `.app`, `.ai` and `.sh` are also file extensions but are real,
# widely-used domains — the owner's own reference list contains `squoosh.app`,
# `consensus.app` and `carbon.now.sh`. `.py`, `.pl` and `.rs` are Paraguay,
# Poland and Serbia. Excluding any of those would break working links to fix
# a rarer nuisance.
